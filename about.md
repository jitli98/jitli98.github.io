Hi! My name is Gerry Gan and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science 
at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I'm proficient at programming with Java
and also have experience using JavaScript frameworks like Express through the [personal projects](https://jitli98.github.io/categories/#Projects) I've worked on. I have also worked with both SQL and NoSQL Databases.
