Hi! My name is Jit Gan and I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science 
at the University of Washington. I have experience using JavaScript frameworks
like Express and NodeJS and have also worked with both SQL and NoSQL Databases.
As of now, I'm trying to get my feet wet in front end development through the
REACT framework.
