[ChatRoom](https://jitchatroom.herokuapp.com/) is a web application that I created whilst learning about back-end web development. The application features a sign in page whereby users would automatically create a new account by signing in with a new username. Once the user has signed in, the user would be passed JSONWebTokens to authenticate his/her access into the chat application. Once the user has successfully authenticated, he/she could start chatting with other users of the applicaiton. The messages would then be persisted in the database where it is retrieved whenever the chat application is opened.
