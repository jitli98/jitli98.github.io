WhatsInYourFridge is an application that I made with my team at a hackathon to help users reduce food wastage in their own homes. It requires users to take a photo of their fridges and the photo would then be analyzed using Google's Computer Vision API for ingredients. Using the list of ingredients, the application would generate recipes that the user could ideally cook with what they have in their fridge.
